# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI agents when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

kdn is a command-line interface for launching and managing AI agents (Claude Code, Goose, Cursor, OpenCode, OpenClaw) with custom configurations. It provides a unified way to start different agents with specific settings including skills, MCP server connections, and LLM integrations.

## Build and Test Commands

All build and test commands are available through the Makefile. Run `make help` to see all available commands.

### Build
```bash
make build
```

### Execute
After building, the `kdn` binary will be created in the current directory:

```bash
# Display help and available commands
./kdn --help

# Execute a specific command
./kdn <command> [flags]
```

### Run Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage report
make test-coverage
```

For more granular testing (specific packages or tests), use Go directly:
```bash
# Run tests in a specific package
go test ./pkg/cmd

# Run a specific test
go test -run TestName ./pkg/cmd
```

### Format Code
```bash
# Format all Go files in the project
make fmt

# Check if code is formatted (without modifying files)
make check-fmt
```

Code should be formatted before committing. Run `make fmt` to ensure consistent style across the codebase.

### Git Hooks

The project includes pre-commit and commit-msg hooks in `.githooks/` that enforce formatting checks (`make check-fmt`) and signed-off commits. Activate them once after cloning:

```bash
make setup-hooks
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Run integration tests (requires Podman)
make test-integration
```

### Additional Commands
```bash
# Run go vet
make vet

# Run all CI checks (format check, vet, tests)
make ci-checks

# Clean build artifacts
make clean

# Install binary to GOPATH/bin
make install
```

## Architecture

### Command Structure (Cobra-based)
- Entry point: `cmd/kdn/main.go` → calls `cmd.NewRootCmd().Execute()` and handles errors with `os.Exit(1)`
- Root command: `pkg/cmd/root.go` exports `NewRootCmd()` which creates and configures the root command
- Subcommands: Each command is in `pkg/cmd/<command>.go` with a `New<Command>Cmd()` factory function
- Commands use a factory pattern: each command exports a `New<Command>Cmd()` function that returns `*cobra.Command`
- Command registration: `NewRootCmd()` calls `rootCmd.AddCommand(New<Command>Cmd())` for each subcommand
- No global variables or `init()` functions - all configuration is explicit through factory functions

### Global Flags
Global flags are defined as persistent flags in `pkg/cmd/root.go` and are available to all commands.

#### Accessing the --storage Flag

The `--storage` flag specifies the directory where kdn stores all its files. The default path is computed at runtime using `os.UserHomeDir()` and `filepath.Join()` to ensure cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows). The default is `$HOME/.kdn` with a fallback to `.kdn` in the current directory if the home directory cannot be determined.

**Environment Variable**: The `KDN_STORAGE` environment variable can be used to set the storage directory path. The flag `--storage` will override the environment variable if both are specified.

**Priority order** (highest to lowest):
1. `--storage` flag (if specified)
2. `KDN_STORAGE` environment variable (if set)
3. Default: `$HOME/.kdn`

To access this value in any command:

```go
func NewExampleCmd() *cobra.Command {
    return &cobra.Command{
        Use:   "example",
        Short: "An example command",
        Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
            storagePath, _ := cmd.Flags().GetString("storage")
            // Use storagePath...
        },
    }
}
```

**Important**: Never hardcode paths with `~` as it's not cross-platform. Always use `os.UserHomeDir()` and `filepath.Join()` for path construction.

### Module Design Pattern

All modules (packages outside of `cmd/`) MUST follow the interface-based design pattern to ensure proper encapsulation, testability, and API safety.

**Required Pattern:**
1. **Public types are interfaces** - All public types must be declared as interfaces
2. **Implementations are unexported** - Concrete struct implementations must be unexported (lowercase names)
3. **Compile-time interface checks** - Add unnamed variable declarations to verify interface implementation at compile time
4. **Factory functions** - Provide `New*()` functions that return the interface type

**Benefits:**
- Prevents direct struct instantiation (compile-time enforcement)
- Forces usage of factory functions for proper validation and initialization
- Enables easy mocking in tests
- Clear API boundaries
- Better encapsulation

**This pattern is MANDATORY for all new modules in `pkg/`.**

### JSON Storage Structure

When designing JSON storage structures for persistent data, use **nested objects with subfields** instead of flat structures with naming conventions.

**Preferred Pattern (nested structure):**
```json
{
  "id": "dc610bffa75f21b5b043f98aff12b157fb16fae6c0ac3139c28f85d6defbe017",
  "paths": {
    "source": "/Users/user/project",
    "configuration": "/Users/user/project/.kaiden"
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- **Better organization** - Related fields are grouped together
- **Clarity** - Field relationships are explicit through nesting
- **Extensibility** - Easy to add new subfields without polluting the top level
- **No naming conflicts** - Avoids debates about snake_case vs camelCase
- **Self-documenting** - Structure communicates intent

### Runtime System

The runtime system provides a pluggable architecture for managing workspaces on different container/VM platforms (Podman, MicroVM, Kubernetes, etc.).

**Key Components:**
- **Runtime Interface** (`pkg/runtime/runtime.go`): Contract all runtimes must implement
- **Registry** (`pkg/runtime/registry.go`): Manages runtime registration and discovery
- **Runtime Implementations** (`pkg/runtime/<runtime-name>/`): Platform-specific packages (e.g., `fake`, `podman`, `openshell`)
- **Centralized Registration** (`pkg/runtimesetup/register.go`): Automatically registers all available runtimes

**Optional Interfaces:**
- **StorageAware**: Enables runtimes to persist data in a dedicated storage directory
- **AgentLister**: Enables runtimes to report which agents they support
- **Terminal**: Enables interactive terminal sessions with instances (auto-starts if needed)
- **Dashboard**: Enables runtimes to expose a web dashboard URL (`GetURL(ctx, instanceID) (string, error)`)
- **FlagProvider**: Enables runtimes to declare runtime-specific CLI flags (`Flags() []FlagDef`). Flag values flow through `AddOptions.RuntimeOptions` and `CreateParams.RuntimeOptions` as `map[string]string`, keeping the command layer runtime-agnostic. The `runtimesetup.ListFlags()` bridge discovers flags from all available runtimes for registration on cobra commands.
- **Experimental**: Signals that a runtime's support is experimental. The `init` command detects this interface via `manager.GetRuntime()` and prints `⚠️  <DisplayName> runtime support is experimental` to stderr using the runtime's `DisplayName()` (suppressed in JSON output mode). No return value — presence of the interface is the signal. Currently implemented by: `openshell`.

**For detailed runtime implementation guidance, use:** `/working-with-runtime-system`

**To add a new runtime, use:** `/add-runtime`

### OpenShell Runtime — Version Management

The OpenShell runtime downloads three binaries (`openshell`, `openshell-gateway`, `openshell-driver-vm`) from official GitHub releases at `https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/releases`.

**Default version constant:** `pkg/runtime/openshell/version.go` defines `DefaultVersion` (currently `v0.0.37`). To bump the default, edit this single constant.

**`--openshell-version` flag:** Users can override the version at `kdn init` time (e.g., `kdn init --openshell-version v0.1.0`). The flag value flows through `RuntimeOptions["openshell-version"]` and is read in `Create()` before binaries are downloaded.

**Binary caching:** Binaries are cached per version at `<storageDir>/bin/<version>/`. Different versions coexist without conflict.

### Podman Runtime — Deny-mode Networking

When a workspace has `network.mode = deny`, the Podman runtime enforces outbound traffic filtering on every `Start()` using two layers. Allowed hosts come from `network.hosts` and are automatically augmented by host patterns derived from configured secrets. With no allowed hosts at all, the approval-handler denies every request (fully-isolated workspace).

1. **nftables firewall (kernel level)**: A `network-guard` sidecar with `CAP_NET_ADMIN` runs nftables rules that DROP outbound traffic from the agent's UID. Loopback and `host.containers.internal` are always allowed. This prevents bypassing the proxy by unsetting `HTTP_PROXY`.
2. **OneCLI proxy (application level)**: All existing OneCLI rules are deleted, a single `manual_approval` rule for `*` is created (**`"allow"` is not a valid OneCLI action**), and the `approval-handler` sidecar approves/denies intercepted requests by hostname pattern.

**Secret host auto-injection:** When secrets are configured, `collectSecretHosts()` (in `network.go`) reads their host patterns from the secret service registry (known types) or stored metadata (`other` type) and merges them with the explicit `network.hosts` list. The `podmanRuntime` receives the `secretservice.Registry` via `SetSecretServiceRegistry()`, called by `manager.RegisterRuntime()` for runtimes that implement the `secretServiceRegistryAware` interface.

**Key files:**
- `pkg/runtime/podman/network.go` — `configureNetworking` / `clearNetworkingRules` / `setupFirewallRules` / `clearFirewallRules` / `buildNftScript` / `collectSecretHosts` / `mergeHosts`
- `pkg/runtime/podman/pods/approval-handler.ts` — Node.js sidecar (TypeScript, runs via `tsx`)
- `pkg/runtime/podman/pods/onecli-pod.yaml` — pod manifest with the approval-handler, network-guard, and OneCLI containers
- `pkg/runtime/podman/system/path.go` / `path_windows.go` — `HostPathToMachinePath` / `MachinePathToHostPath` for translating host paths to Podman Machine (WSL2) paths on Windows; no-ops on Linux/macOS

**Per-workspace temporary directories:** The Podman runtime writes files into subdirectories of `<storage-dir>/<dir>/<workspace-name>/` for each workspace it creates. These directories are cleaned up when the workspace is removed. The authoritative list is the `workspaceTempDirs` variable in `pkg/runtime/podman/remove.go`. **If you add a new per-workspace directory under `storageDir`, add its name to that slice** so `Remove()` cleans it up automatically.

**For the full design, use:** `/working-with-onecli`

### Secret Service System

The secret service system provides a pluggable architecture for managing secret service definitions that describe how secrets are applied to workspace requests.

**Key Components:**
- **SecretService Interface** (`pkg/secretservice/secretservice.go`): Contract all secret services must implement (`Name()`, `Description()`, `HostsPatterns()`, `Path()`, `EnvVars()`, `HeaderName()`, `HeaderTemplate()`)
- **Registry** (`pkg/secretservice/registry.go`): Manages secret service registration and discovery
- **Centralized Registration** (`pkg/secretservicesetup/register.go`): Automatically registers all available secret services; `ListAvailable()` returns the names of all registered services (used by commands to derive valid `--type` values dynamically); `ListServices()` returns fully-constructed service instances (used by `autoconf` to iterate env vars)

**For detailed guidance on the full secrets abstraction (Store, registry, adding new types), use:** `/working-with-secrets`

### Credential System

The credential system provides a pluggable architecture for intercepting sensitive credential files that users mount into workspace containers. When a declared mount targets a known credential file (e.g., `$HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json`), kdn replaces the real file with a placeholder and configures OneCLI to inject the real credential at request time.

**Key Components:**
- **`Credential` interface** (`pkg/credential/credential.go`): Contract all credentials must implement:
  - `Name() string` — unique identifier
  - `ContainerFilePath() string` — absolute path inside the container where the credential file lives
  - `Detect(mounts []workspace.Mount, homeDir string) (hostFilePath string, intercepted *workspace.Mount)` — returns the real host path and the mount to intercept, or `("", nil)` if not applicable
  - `FakeFile(hostFilePath string) ([]byte, error)` — returns placeholder file content (no real credentials)
  - `Configure(ctx, client onecli.Client, hostFilePath string) error` — reads the real file and registers the credential with OneCLI
  - `HostPatterns(hostFilePath string) []string` — hostnames OneCLI must be allowed to reach for this credential
- **Registry** (`pkg/credential/registry.go`): Thread-safe ordered list; `NewRegistry() Registry`; `Register()` rejects nil, empty name, and duplicates
- **Centralized Registration** (`pkg/credentialsetup/register.go`): `RegisterAll(registrar)` registers all built-in credentials (currently `gcloud`)
- **`CredentialRegistryAware`** optional runtime interface (`pkg/runtime/runtime.go`): Runtimes that implement `SetCredentialRegistry(credential.Registry)` receive the registry automatically when `manager.RegisterRuntime()` is called

**Podman runtime integration:**
- `detectCredentials()` in `create.go` iterates the registry at `Create` time, writes fake files to `<storageDir>/credentials/<workspaceName>/<credName>/credential` (mode `0600`), and returns `[]activeCredential`
- Fake credential mounts are added to the container; intercepted original mounts are suppressed via an `interceptedMounts map[mountKey]bool`
- `setupOnecli` calls `cred.Configure()` for each active credential to register it with OneCLI
- `collectCredentialHosts()` in `start.go` merges credential host patterns into the network allow-list
- Credential directories are cleaned up on workspace removal via the `"credentials"` entry in `workspaceTempDirs` (`pkg/runtime/podman/remove.go`)

**Per-workspace credential directory layout:**

```text
<storageDir>/
  credentials/
    <workspaceName>/
      <credName>/
        credential    ← fake placeholder file (mode 0600)
```

**Implementations:**
- `pkg/credential/gcloud/` — Google Cloud ADC (`application_default_credentials.json`); configures OneCLI Vertex AI via `ConnectApp`
- `pkg/credential/kubeconfig/` — Kubernetes token-based auth (`~/.kube/config`); detects by mount target (`$HOME/.kube/config` or `$HOME/.kube`), activates only when the current context uses token auth (not client certs), writes a pruned single-context kubeconfig with a placeholder token, and registers an OneCLI `Authorization: Bearer` secret for the cluster API server host

### Dev Container Features

The `pkg/devcontainers/features` package models, downloads, and orders Dev Container Features (OCI registry artifacts or local file trees) prior to container image generation.

**Key Components:**
- **`Feature` interface** (`pkg/devcontainers/features/features.go`): `ID()` + `Download(ctx, destDir) (FeatureMetadata, error)`
- **`FeatureMetadata` interface**: exposes `ContainerEnv()`, `Options()`, `InstallsAfter()` parsed from `devcontainer-feature.json`
- **`FeatureOptions` interface**: `Merge(userOptions) (map[string]string, error)` — normalises keys (uppercase, non-alphanumeric → `_`), applies defaults, validates types and enums
- **`FromMap`**: classifies IDs (`./…` → local, `https?://` → error, otherwise → OCI), returns a sorted `[]Feature` slice plus the user-options map — no I/O
- **`Order`**: topological sort (Kahn's algorithm) on `installsAfter` fields; matches versionless `installsAfter` IDs against versioned registered IDs by stripping the tag

**Typical call sequence:** `FromMap` → `Feature.Download` (parallel) → `Order` → `FeatureOptions.Merge` per feature.

**Podman runtime integration** (`pkg/runtime/podman/create.go`):
- `prepareFeatures()` drives the full sequence when `WorkspaceConfig.Features` is non-empty
- Features are downloaded into `<instanceDir>/features/feature-{i}/` (stable names based on `FromMap`'s sorted output)
- Each feature becomes a `featureInstallInfo{dirName, options, envVars}` passed to `generateContainerfile()`
- `WorkspaceConfigDir` is required in `CreateParams` so `FromMap` can resolve `./local-feature` paths
- In the Containerfile, feature `COPY`/`RUN`/`ENV` instructions are placed after user creation (`useradd -m agent`) but before `USER agent:agent` — features still run as root so they can install system-wide tools, but `/home/agent` and the `agent` account exist so install scripts can `chown`, write dotfiles, and `su` to the target user. `_REMOTE_USER` and `_REMOTE_USER_HOME` are exported as `ENV` immediately before the feature block

**Config merger requirement:** The `pkg/config/merger.go` `Merge()` and `copyConfig()` functions must explicitly handle every field of `WorkspaceConfiguration`. Fields not wired in are silently dropped. `Features` is handled via `mergeFeatures()` / `copyFeatures()`; `Ports` is handled via `mergePorts()` / inline copy.

**For full implementation details, use:** `/working-with-devcontainers`

### StepLogger System

The StepLogger system provides user-facing progress feedback during runtime operations with spinners and completion messages.

**Key Points:**
- Commands inject StepLogger into context based on output mode (text with spinners vs JSON silent)
- Runtime methods retrieve logger from context and report progress steps
- Automatic behavior: animated spinners in text mode, silent in JSON mode

**For detailed StepLogger integration guidance, use:** `/working-with-steplogger`

### Logger System

The Logger system (`pkg/logger`) routes stdout and stderr from runtime CLI commands (e.g., `podman build`) to the user. It is controlled by the `--show-logs` flag.

**Key Points:**
- Commands inject a `logger.Logger` into context based on the `--show-logs` flag
- Runtime methods retrieve it from context and pass its writers to CLI command execution
- When `--show-logs` is set, output is written to the command's stdout/stderr; otherwise it is discarded
- `--show-logs` cannot be combined with `--output json` (enforced in `preRun`)

**Interface** (`pkg/logger/logger.go`):
```go
type Logger interface {
    Stdout() io.Writer
    Stderr() io.Writer
}
```

**Context integration** (`pkg/logger/context.go`): `WithLogger()` / `FromContext()` — mirrors the StepLogger pattern.

### Environment Variable Utilities

The `pkg/envvars` package provides shared helpers for reading environment variables.

**`IsTruthy(key string) bool`** — returns `true` if the environment variable named by `key` is set to a recognised truthy string (`1`, `true`, `True`, `TRUE`, `yes`, `Yes`, `YES`). Use this instead of inlining a `switch` whenever a boolean env var controls behaviour.

### OneCLI System

The OneCLI system (`pkg/onecli`) provides a typed HTTP client and higher-level abstractions for interacting with the OneCLI API, which proxies outbound HTTP requests and injects secrets as headers inside workspace containers.

**Key Points:**
- `Client` — raw CRUD for secrets and networking rules against the OneCLI API
- `CredentialProvider` — retrieves the `oc_` API key from `/api/user/api-key` (bootstraps local user on first call)
- `SecretMapper` — converts `workspace.Secret` values to `CreateSecretInput` for the API; handles known types via the secret service registry and the `other` type via explicit fields
- `SecretProvisioner` — idempotently creates or updates secrets; handles 409 conflicts by patching the existing secret

**For detailed OneCLI integration guidance, use:** `/working-with-onecli`

### Config System

The config system manages workspace configuration for **injecting environment variables, mounting directories, providing skills, configuring MCP servers, managing secrets and controlling network access** into workspaces (different from runtime-specific configuration).

**Multi-Level Configuration:**
- **Workspace-level** (`.kaiden/workspace.json`) - Project configuration, set via `--workspace-configuration` flag
- **Project-specific** (`~/.kdn/config/projects.json`) - User's custom config for specific projects
- **Global** (empty string `""` key in `projects.json`) - Settings applied to all projects
- **Agent-specific** (`~/.kdn/config/agents.json`) - Per-agent overrides

**Configuration Precedence:** Agent > Project > Global > Workspace (highest to lowest)

**Key config interfaces in `pkg/config/`:**

- **`WorkspaceConfigUpdater`** (`workspaceupdater.go`): Reads/writes `.kaiden/workspace.json`. Methods: `AddSecret(name)`, `AddEnvVar(name, value)`, `AddMount(host, target, ro)`.
- **`ProjectConfigUpdater`** (`projectsupdater.go`): Reads/writes `~/.kdn/config/projects.json`. Methods: `AddSecret(projectID, secretName)`, `AddMount(projectID, host, target string, ro bool)`. Pass `""` as `projectID` for the global entry. Both methods are idempotent.
- **`AgentConfigUpdater`** (`agents.go`): Reads/writes `~/.kdn/config/agents.json` per agent. Methods: `AddEnvVar(agentName, name, value)`, `AddMount(agentName, host, target, ro)`. Used by `kdn autoconf` to record Vertex AI config for the `claude` agent.
- **`AgentConfigLoader`** (`agents.go`): Loads a `WorkspaceConfiguration` for a named agent from `agents.json`. Returns an empty config (not an error) when the file or agent key is absent.

### Agent Default Settings Files

A separate mechanism (distinct from env/mount config) allows default dotfiles to be baked into the workspace image:

- **Location:** `~/.kdn/config/<agent>/` (e.g., `~/.kdn/config/claude/`)
- Files are read by `manager.readAgentSettings()` into a `map[string]agent.SettingsFile` and passed to the runtime via `runtime.CreateParams.AgentSettings`
- After reading, the manager calls `agent.SkipOnboarding()`, `agent.SetModel()` (if a model is set), and `agent.SetMCPServers()` (if MCP is configured) to further modify the settings map
- The Podman runtime writes these files into the build context as `agent-settings/` and adds `COPY --chown=agent:agent agent-settings/. /home/agent/` to the Containerfile
- Result: every file under `config/<agent>/` lands at the corresponding path under `/home/agent/` inside the image

**For detailed guidance, use:** `/working-with-config-system`

**For detailed configuration guidance, use:** `/working-with-config-system`

### Podman Runtime Configuration

The Podman runtime supports runtime-specific configuration for **building and configuring containers** (base image, packages, sudo permissions, agent setup).

**Configuration Files:**
- `<storage-dir>/runtimes/podman/config/image.json` - Base image configuration
- `<storage-dir>/runtimes/podman/config/claude.json` - Claude agent configuration
- `<storage-dir>/runtimes/podman/config/goose.json` - Goose agent configuration
- `<storage-dir>/runtimes/podman/config/opencode.json` - OpenCode agent configuration
- `<storage-dir>/runtimes/podman/config/openclaw.json` - OpenClaw agent configuration

**For Podman runtime configuration details, use:** `/working-with-podman-runtime-config`

### OpenClaw on Podman

The OpenClaw agent runs a local gateway on port 18789 inside the container. The terminal command starts the gateway in the background, waits for it to be ready, then launches the `openclaw` CLI. Type `talk to agent` in the CLI to start a chatbot conversation.

To access the OpenClaw web UI, first start the workspace terminal and wait for the CLI to become ready:

```bash
kdn terminal <workspace-name>
```

Then, in a separate session, open the web UI:

```bash
kdn workspace open <workspace-name>
```

This opens the browser to the gateway's control UI. Enter `openclaw123` as the gateway token to authenticate.

The gateway token and other defaults are configured via `SkipOnboarding()` in `pkg/agent/openclaw.go`, which writes to `.openclaw/openclaw.json` inside the container.

### Skills System

Skills are reusable capabilities that can be discovered and executed by AI agents:

- **Location**: `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- **Claude support**: `.claude/skills` is a symlink to `../.agents/skills`, so Claude Code discovers skills automatically
- **Format**: Each SKILL.md contains:
  - YAML frontmatter with `name`, `description`, `argument-hint`
  - Detailed instructions for execution
  - Usage examples

Skills can be provided to workspaces via the `skills` field in `workspace.json` (or any other config level). Each entry is the path to a single skill directory on the host. kdn mounts it read-only into the agent's skills directory inside the container using the directory's basename as the skill name:

| Agent | Container skills directory |
|-------|--------------------------|
| Claude Code | `$HOME/.claude/skills/` |
| Goose | `$HOME/.agents/skills/` |
| Cursor | `$HOME/.cursor/skills/` |
| OpenCode | `$HOME/.opencode/skills/` |
| OpenClaw | `$HOME/.openclaw/skills/` |

The `Agent` interface (`pkg/agent/agent.go`) exposes `SkillsDir() string` which returns the container path (using the `$HOME` variable) where skill directories should be mounted. The manager calls this during `Add()` to convert `WorkspaceConfig.Skills` entries into `workspace.Mount` entries before passing the config to the runtime.

### Adding a New Skill
1. Create directory: `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/`
2. Create SKILL.md with frontmatter and instructions
3. No symlink step needed — `.claude/skills` already symlinks to `.agents/skills/`

### Adding a New Command

**Available Skills:**
- `/add-command-simple` - For commands without JSON output support
- `/add-command-with-json` - For commands with JSON output support
- `/add-alias-command` - For alias commands that delegate to existing commands
- `/add-parent-command` - For parent commands with subcommands

**All commands MUST:**
- Define the `Args` field for argument validation (`cobra.NoArgs`, `cobra.ExactArgs(n)`, etc.)
- Include an `Example` field with usage examples
- Have a corresponding `Test<Command>Cmd_Examples` test function to validate examples

**For advanced command patterns, use:** `/implementing-command-patterns`

**For JSON output types (where they are defined and how to use them), use:** `/working-with-json-output-types`

**For testing commands, use:** `/testing-commands`

### Working with the Instances Manager

The instances manager provides the API for managing workspace instances:

```go
// Create manager
manager, err := instances.NewManager(storageDir)

// Register runtimes
runtimesetup.RegisterAll(manager)

// Register agents
agentsetup.RegisterAll(manager)

// Register secret services
secretservicesetup.RegisterAll(manager)

// Add instance
manager.Add(ctx, instances.AddOptions{...})

// List, Get, Delete instances
manager.List()
manager.Get(id)
manager.Delete(id)

// Start, Stop instances
manager.Start(ctx, id)
manager.Stop(ctx, id)

// Dashboard URL (returns ErrDashboardNotSupported if runtime does not implement Dashboard)
manager.GetDashboardURL(ctx, id)

// Interactive terminal
manager.Terminal(ctx, id, []string{"bash"})

// Retrieve a registered runtime by type (e.g. to check optional interfaces like Experimental)
manager.GetRuntime(runtimeType)
```

**Workspace Name Sanitization:** The manager automatically sanitizes workspace names — whether auto-generated from the source directory basename or provided via `--name`. Names are lowercased and any run of invalid characters (spaces, `@`, etc.) is collapsed into a single hyphen. This ensures compatibility with runtimes like Podman that require lowercase image names.

**For detailed manager API and project detection, use:** `/working-with-instances-manager`

### Project Identifier Detection

The `pkg/project` package provides a single shared implementation for computing stable project identifiers from a source directory. Both the instances manager and the `autoconf` command use it so the identifier is always derived the same way.

**Key Components:**
- **`Detector` interface** (`pkg/project/project.go`): Single method `DetectProject(ctx, dir) string`
- **`NewDetector(git.Detector) Detector`**: Factory — wraps a `git.Detector` to resolve repository info

**Detection rules (in priority order):**
1. Git repo with remote URL → `<remoteURL>/` or `<remoteURL>/<relPath>`
2. Git repo without remote → `filepath.Join(rootDir, relPath)` (or just `rootDir`)
3. Not a git repo → `dir` as-is

**Usage:**
```go
detector := project.NewDetector(git.NewDetector())
projectID := detector.DetectProject(ctx, sourceDir)
```

**Integration points:**
- `instances.NewManager` wraps `project.NewDetector(git.NewDetector())` internally; `newManagerWithFactory` accepts a `project.Detector` for test injection
- `autoconfCmd` stores a `project.Detector` field with a nil guard in `preRun`; inject a fake in tests

### Cross-Platform Path Handling

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: All path operations and tests MUST be cross-platform compatible (Linux, macOS, Windows).

**Core Rules:**
- **Host paths** (files on disk): Use `filepath.Join()` - works on Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Container paths** (inside Podman): Use `path.Join()` - containers are always Unix/Linux
- Convert relative paths to absolute with `filepath.Abs()`
- Never hardcode paths with `~` - use `os.UserHomeDir()` instead
- **Use `t.TempDir()` for ALL temporary directories in tests**

**Example:**
```go
import (
    "path"           // For container paths
    "path/filepath"  // For host paths
)

// Host path (cross-platform)
configDir := filepath.Join(storageDir, ".kaiden")

// Container path (always Unix)
workspacePath := path.Join("/workspace", "sources")
```

**For detailed cross-platform patterns, use:** `/cross-platform-development`

## Documentation Standards

### Markdown Best Practices

All markdown files (*.md) in this repository must follow these standards:

**Fenced Code Blocks:**
- **ALWAYS** include a language tag in fenced code blocks
- Use the appropriate language identifier (`bash`, `go`, `json`, `yaml`, `text`, etc.)
- For output examples or plain text content, use `text` as the language tag
- This ensures markdown linters (markdownlint MD040) pass and improves syntax highlighting

**Common Language Tags:**
- `bash` - Shell commands and scripts
- `go` - Go source code
- `json` - JSON data structures
- `yaml` - YAML configuration files
- `text` - Plain text output, error messages, or generic content
- `markdown` - Markdown examples

## Copyright Headers

All source files must include Apache License 2.0 copyright headers with Red Hat copyright. Use the `/copyright-headers` skill to add or update headers automatically. The current year is 2026.

Tests follow Go conventions with `*_test.go` files alongside source files. Tests use the standard `testing` package and should cover command initialization, execution, and error cases.

### Parallel Test Execution

**All tests MUST call `t.Parallel()` as the first line of the test function.**

**Exception:** Tests using `t.Setenv()` cannot use `t.Parallel()` on the parent test function.

**For general testing best practices, use:** `/testing-best-practices`

**For command testing patterns, use:** `/testing-commands`

**For cross-platform testing, use:** `/cross-platform-development`

**Before submitting a PR (code, tests, docs checklist), use:** `/complete-pr`

## GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions workflows are stored in `.github/workflows/`. All workflows must use commit SHA1 hashes instead of version tags for security reasons (to prevent supply chain attacks from tag manipulation).

Example:
```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@de0fac2e4500dabe0009e67214ff5f5447ce83dd # v6.0.2
```

Always include the version as a comment for readability.
